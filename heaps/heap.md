There are two types of heaps: **min heaps** and **max heaps**

## Min Heaps

**Min heaps** are **trees** where the **parent node values are smaller** or equal to the child node values

## Max Heaps

**Max heaps** are **trees** where the **parent node values are bigger** or equal to the child node values
